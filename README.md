# 🎄 Advent of Code solutions

This repository contains my attempts to solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. They are not elegant but work well.

**❗❗❗ I highly recommend trying to solve problems yourself before looking for solutions from others, it will be more rewarding and fun! 😉**

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Set your session cookie to environment variable COOKIE in `.env` file:
```dotenv
COOKIE="session=qwerty12345"
```
You can get it from request header `cookie` or from browser cookies, obviously.

3. Run the command:
```bash
# for day 1 of year 2021
npm run day 2021 1
```
